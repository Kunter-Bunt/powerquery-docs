4. In the **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** window that appears, select which data you want to return, either **All contacts** or **Selected contacts** from the first drop-down selector. You can then specify the start and end dates to constrain the data it receives to a particular time window.

5. Once you've provided the information, Power BI Desktop connects to the data associated with your LinkedIn Sales Navigator contract. Use the same email address you use to sign in to LinkedIn Sales Navigator through the website.

   Once you've selected the data you require, either select **Transform Data** to continue tranforming the data in the Power Query editor, or select **Load** to load the data into Power BI Desktop. Once in Power BI Desktop, you can create whatever reports you like with your LinkedIn Sales Navigator data.
