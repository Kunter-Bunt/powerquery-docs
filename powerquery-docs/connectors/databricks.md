| ---- | ----------- |
| Release State | General Availability |
| Products | Power BI (Semantic models)<br/>Power BI (Dataflows)<br/>Fabric (Dataflow Gen2) |
| Authentication Types Supported | Azure Active Directory<br/>Personal Access Token<br/> OAuth (OIDC) |

> [!NOTE]
>Some capabilities may be present in one product but not others due to deployment schedules and host-specific capabilities.

## Prerequisites

This connector is only for use with a Databricks SQL Warehouse running on AWS and using OAuth. If you're using Azure Databricks, use the [Azure Databricks](databricks-azure.md) connector. If you aren't using OAuth with your Databricks SQL Warehouse (on AWS or GCP), use the [Azure Databricks](databricks-azure.md) connector too. Databricks Community Edition isn't supported.

## Capabilities supported

* Import
* DirectQuery (Power BI semantic models)

## Connect to Databricks from Power Query Desktop

To connect to Databricks from Power Query Desktop, take the following steps:

1. In the Get Data experience, search for **Databricks** to shortlist the **Databricks** connector. You should only use the **Databricks** connector here for your Databricks SQL Warehouse data (running on AWS) if you're using OAuth for authentication.

2. Provide the **Server hostname** and **HTTP Path** for your Databricks SQL Warehouse. Refer to [Configure the Databricks ODBC and JDBC drivers](/azure/databricks/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi) for instructions to look up your "Server hostname" and "HTTP Path". Enter this information accordingly. You can optionally supply a default catalog and/or database under **Advanced options**. Select **OK** to continue.

3. Provide your credentials to authenticate with your Databricks SQL Warehouse. You have three options for credentials:

    * Username / Password. This option isn't available if your organization/account uses 2FA/MFA.
    * Personal Access Token. Refer to [Personal access tokens](/azure/databricks/sql/user/security/personal-access-tokens) for instructions on generating a Personal Access Token (PAT).
    * OAuth (OIDC). Sign in to your organizational account using the browser popup.

      ![Specify an appropriate token.](./media/databricks/dbc-pat.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Once you enter your credentials for a particular Databricks SQL Warehouse, Power BI Desktop caches and reuses those same credentials in subsequent connection attempts. You can modify those credentials by going to **File > Options and settings > Data source settings**. More information: [Change the authentication method](../ConnectorAuthentication.md#change-the-authentication-method)

4. Once you successfully connect, the **Navigator** shows the data available to you on the cluster. You can choose either **Transform Data** to transform the data using Power Query or **Load** to load the data in Power Query Desktop.

## Connect to Databricks data from Power Query Online

To connect to Databricks from Power Query Online, take the following steps:

1. In the Get Data experience, select the **Dataflow** category. (Refer to [Creating a dataflow](/power-bi/transform-model/dataflows/dataflows-create) for instructions.) Shortlist the available Databricks connector with the search box. Select the **Databricks** connector for your Databricks SQL Warehouse.

2. Enter the **Server hostname** and **HTTP Path** for your Databricks SQL Warehouse. Refer to [Configure the Databricks ODBC and JDBC drivers](/azure/databricks/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi) for instructions to look up your "Server hostname" and "HTTP Path". You can optionally supply a default catalog and/or database under **Advanced options**.

3. Provide your credentials to authenticate with your Databricks SQL Warehouse. There are three options for credentials:

    * Basic. Use this option when authenticating with a user name and password. This option isn't available if your organization/account uses 2FA/MFA.
    * Account Key. Use this option when authenticating using a Personal Access Token. Refer to [Personal access tokens](/azure/databricks/sql/user/security/personal-access-tokens) for instructions on generating a Personal Access Token (PAT).
    * Organizational account. Use this option when authenticating with OAuth. Sign in to your organizational account using the browser popup.

4. Once you successfully connect, the **Navigator** appears and displays the data available on the server. Select your data in the navigator. Then select **Next** to transform the data in Power Query.
