## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. Go to [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

* An Azure Analysis Services server. Follow the instructions at [Quickstart: Create a server - Portal](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-create-server) for creating the server using the Azure portal. Other articles in this section also include information on creating a server using PowerShell, Bicep, or an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. This connector article assumes that you've already created an Azure Analysis Services server and have an existing database on the server.

## Capabilities Supported

* Import
* Connect live (Power BI semantic models)
* Advanced options
  * MDX or DAX query

## Connect to Azure Analysis Services database from Power Query Desktop

To make the connection, take the following steps:

1. Select the **Azure Analysis Services database** option in the connector selection. More information: [Where to get data](../where-to-get-data.md)

2. In the **SQL Server Analysis Services database** dialog that appears, provide the name of the server and database (optional).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Only Power BI Desktop will display the **Import** and **Connect live** options. If you're connecting using Power BI Desktop, selecting **Connect live** uses a live connection to load the connected data directly to Power BI Desktop. In this case, you can't use Power Query to transform your data before loading the data to Power BI Desktop. For the purposes of this article, the **Import** option is selected. For more information about using a live connection in Power BI Desktop, go to [Connect to Analysis Services tabular data in Power BI Desktop](/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-analysis-services-tabular-data).

3. Select **OK**.

4. If you're connecting to this database for the first time, select the authentication type and input your credentials. Then select **Connect**.

5. In **Navigator**, select the database information you want, then either select **Load** to load the data or **Transform Data** to continue transforming the data in the Power Query editor.

## Connect using advanced options

Power Query provides an advanced option that you can add to your query if needed.

| Advanced option | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| MDX or DAX statement | Optionally provides a specific MDX or DAX statement to the Azure Analysis Services database server to execute. |

Once you've entered a value in the advanced option, select **OK** in Power Query Desktop or **Next** in Power Query Online to connect to your Azure Analysis Services database.

## Troubleshooting

### Error indicates “invalid credentials”

If you've enabled the firewall in Azure Analysis Services and you're getting an “invalid credentials” error, you might need to allowlist the IP addresses of the Power Query Online clusters, even if you've allowed access from the Power BI service in your Azure Analysis Services server firewall.

![screenshot](./media/azure-analysis-services/aas-firewall-settings.png)

To allowlist the Power Query Online clusters, download the Azure IP ranges and service tags from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519). You'll need to allowlist the IP addresses from the **PowerQueryOnline** service tag. For more information on how to configure the server firewall, go to [Quickstart: Configure server firewall - Portal](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-qs-firewall).
